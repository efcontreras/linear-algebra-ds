title: "Spectral Theory of Linear Operators"
---

## Motivation

Spectral theory studies how a linear operator acts by decomposing it into
**independent directions** that are scaled.

In finite-dimensional real vector spaces, this means understanding:

- eigenvalues,
- eigenvectors,
- diagonalization,
- orthogonal decompositions.

In Data Science, spectral theory underlies:
- PCA,
- spectral clustering,
- graph Laplacians,
- low-rank approximations.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition (Eigenvalue and eigenvector)</div>

Let $T:V\to V$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$.
A scalar $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ is an **eigenvalue** of $T$ if there exists
a nonzero vector $v\in V$ such that

$$
T(v) = \lambda v.
$$

The vector $v$ is called an **eigenvector** associated with $\lambda$.
:::

For a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, this reads:

$$
Av = \lambda v.
$$

---

## The Characteristic Polynomial

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition (Characteristic polynomial)</div>

The **characteristic polynomial** of $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is

$$
p_A(\lambda) := \det(A - \lambda I).
$$
:::

Eigenvalues are the roots of $p_A$.

---

## Algebraic vs. Geometric Multiplicity

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition</div>

Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$.

- Its **algebraic multiplicity** is its multiplicity as a root of $p_A$.
- Its **geometric multiplicity** is
  $$
  \dim \ker(A - \lambda I).
  $$
:::

Always:
$$
1 \le \text{geometric multiplicity} \le \text{algebraic multiplicity}.
$$

---

## Diagonalization

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition (Diagonalizable matrix)</div>

A matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is **diagonalizable** if there exists
an invertible matrix $P$ such that

$$
A = P D P^{-1},
$$

where $D$ is diagonal.
:::

Diagonal entries of $D$ are eigenvalues of $A$.

---

## Why Diagonalization Matters

If $A = P D P^{-1}$, then:

- powers: $A^k = P D^k P^{-1}$
- exponentials: $e^{tA} = P e^{tD} P^{-1}$
- dynamics decouple into independent modes

This is why spectral theory is fundamental in:
- linear dynamical systems,
- diffusion processes,
- graph methods.

## Self-Adjoint (Symmetric) Operators

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition (Self-adjoint operator)</div>

A linear operator $T:V\to V$ on an inner product space is **self-adjoint**
if

$$
\langle T u, v \rangle = \langle u, T v \rangle
\quad \text{for all } u,v\in V.
$$
:::

In matrix form (Euclidean inner product):

$$
A = A^\top.
$$

## The Spectral Theorem (Finite-Dimensional)

::: {.mathbox .theorem}
<div class="mathbox-title">Theorem (Spectral Theorem)</div>

Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be symmetric.
Then:

1. All eigenvalues of $A$ are real.
2. Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
3. There exists an orthogonal matrix $Q$ such that

$$
A = Q \Lambda Q^\top,
$$

where $\Lambda$ is diagonal.

<details class="proof-toggle">
<summary>Proof idea (click to expand)</summary>

::: {.mathbox .proof}
<div class="mathbox-title">Proof (idea)</div>

The proof uses:
- the fact that symmetric matrices define real quadratic forms,
- maximization of the Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere,
- induction on dimension.

Orthogonality follows from symmetry:
if $Av=\lambda v$ and $Aw=\mu w$ with $\lambda\neq\mu$, then

$$
\lambda \langle v,w\rangle
= \langle Av,w\rangle
= \langle v,Aw\rangle
= \mu \langle v,w\rangle,
$$

so $\langle v,w\rangle=0$.

## Quadratic Forms and Rayleigh Quotient

::: {.mathbox .definition}
<div class="mathbox-title">Definition (Rayleigh quotient)</div>

For a symmetric matrix $A$ and nonzero $x$:

$$
R_A(x) := \frac{x^\top A x}{x^\top x}.
$$
:::

::: {.mathbox .theorem}
<div class="mathbox-title">Theorem</div>

The maximum and minimum values of $R_A(x)$ over $x\neq 0$
are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A$.
:::

This result is the **variational foundation of PCA**.

## Computational Example (Python)

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[2, 1],
              [1, 3]])

eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eigh(A)
eigvals, eigvecs
```

- `np.linalg.eigh` exploits symmetry.
- Eigenvectors returned are orthonormal.

## Geometry of Spectral Decomposition

The decomposition

$$
A = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i\, v_i v_i^\top
$$

shows that a symmetric linear operator acts as:
- projection onto the eigenvector $v_i$,
- followed by scaling by the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.

This representation expresses $A$ as a **sum of rank-1 operators**.

## Data Science Connections

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Given a centered data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, the empirical covariance matrix is

$$
\mathrm{Cov}(X) = \frac{1}{m} X^\top X,
$$

which is symmetric and positive semidefinite.

PCA consists of computing the eigen-decomposition of $\mathrm{Cov}(X)$ and selecting
the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues.

---

### Spectral Clustering

In spectral clustering, data points are viewed as nodes of a graph.
The (normalized) graph Laplacian is a symmetric matrix.

Clustering is performed by embedding nodes using eigenvectors associated
with the smallest nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian.

---

### Optimization and Conditioning

Quadratic objectives of the form

$$
f(x) = x^\top A x
$$

are governed by the spectrum of $A$:

- $f$ is convex if and only if $A \succeq 0$,
- the conditioning of the problem is controlled by the ratio
  $\lambda_{\max} / \lambda_{\min}$.

---

## Summary

- Symmetric matrices admit orthogonal diagonalization.
- Spectral decomposition expresses operators as sums of rank-1 projections.
- PCA and spectral clustering are direct consequences of spectral theory.
- Optimization behavior is dictated by eigenvalues.

## Preview: Singular Value Decomposition

Not all matrices are symmetric.
The **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** extends spectral ideas
to arbitrary rectangular matrices and is the central decomposition
in modern Data Science.
