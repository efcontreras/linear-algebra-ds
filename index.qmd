## What is this project?

This website is a **conceptual and applied guide to Linear Algebra and Spectral Methods**,  
with a clear focus on **Data Science applications**.

The material bridges the gap between:
- mathematical theory (linear algebra, spectral theory),
- and practical tools used in modern data analysis.

Rather than treating algorithms as black boxes, the emphasis is on:
**geometry, structure, and interpretation**.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters in Data Science

Many core methods in Data Science are fundamentally linear and spectral:

- dimensionality reduction,
- regularization and stability,
- clustering and embedding,
- matrix factorization and compression.

Understanding these methods deeply requires more than knowing how to call an API.
It requires understanding:
- vector spaces,
- projections,
- eigenvalues and singular values,
- low-rank structure.

This project shows how these ideas form a **coherent mathematical framework**.

## What You Will Find Here

The site is organized as a progressive narrative.

### Foundations
- Vector spaces and subspaces  
- Linear maps and matrices  
- Inner products, orthogonality, projections  
- Computational cost and complexity  

### Spectral Theory
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Spectral theorem for symmetric operators  
- Rayleigh quotients and quadratic forms  

### Singular Value Decomposition
- SVD as a generalization of spectral theory  
- Geometry of singular vectors  
- Optimal low-rank approximation  

### Applications
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Truncated SVD and ridge regularization  
- Bias–variance trade-offs  
- Spectral clustering and graph Laplacians  

### Synthesis
- A unified view of spectral methods in Data Science  

Each topic is developed with:
- precise definitions,
- key theorems (with proofs when relevant),
- geometric intuition,
- Python examples.

## Who Is This For?

This project is intended for:

- **Data Scientists** who want a deeper understanding of the tools they use,
- **Machine Learning practitioners** interested in model stability and structure,
- **Mathematicians** exploring applied spectral methods,
- **Graduate students** in Data Science, Statistics, or Applied Mathematics.

A basic familiarity with linear algebra is assumed, but advanced topics are developed
from first principles.

## How to Use This Site

You can approach the material in different ways:

- **Theory-first**  
  Start from the foundations and progress toward applications.

- **Application-first**  
  Jump directly to PCA, regularization, or spectral clustering, then trace the theory back.

- **Reference mode**  
  Use the chapters as a conceptual reference for spectral methods.

The chapters are designed to be read independently, while still forming a coherent whole.

## Philosophy

The guiding idea of this project is simple:

> Many data problems are not about finding complex models,  
> but about identifying the right directions.

Spectral methods provide a principled way to do exactly that.
