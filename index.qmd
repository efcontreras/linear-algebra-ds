title: "Linear Algebra Lab"
---

This is a **math-first, code-backed** linear algebra website.

You’ll find:
- definitions, theorems, and proofs (LaTeX),
- computational experiments in Python,
- direct bridges to Data Science (least squares, SVD, PCA, etc.).

Example:

$$
\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}.
$$
